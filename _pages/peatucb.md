UC Berkeley has a stellar Political Economy group spread across various departments. This diversity, though under-exploited, is a strength but people are often not aware of the wide variety of seminars and resources at these departments. Here I attempt to put together some basic details on events and resources for someone interested in Political Economy from an economics angle:

### Seminars/Meetings

1. [Robert Powell Political Economy Seminar](https://haas.berkeley.edu/bcep/conferences-seminars/seminars/): Mondays 12.30-2pm in 223 Moses Hall.
2. [Oliver E. Williamson Seminar on Institutional Analysis](https://haas.berkeley.edu/ibi/events/seminars/oliver-williamson-seminar/): Thursdays 12.30-2pm in 325 Cheit Hall. A mix of talks by invited speakers and brown bag talks by Haas BPP PhD students.
3. [Berkeley Political Economy Research Lab](https://twitter.com/xftrebbi/status/1312443798027268096): Fridays 1-2pm in 132 Cheit Hall. A low-stakes forum for PhD students to discuss (mostly, early stage) projects with peers and faculty members. Does not require formal presentations.

### Conferences hosted at or organized by UC Berkeley

1. Development and Political Economics SF Bay Area PhD Student Conference (DEVPEC), co-organized by UC Berkeley and Stanford University. Usually held in April each year. No stable website but you can refer to event information for [2021](https://kingcenter.stanford.edu/events/student-event/development-and-political-economics-graduate-student-conference-devpec-1) and [2022](https://twitter.com/pbacherikov/status/1496177151527514112?lang=en).
2. [Annual Meeting](https://cega.berkeley.edu/event/working-group-in-african-political-economy-wgape-2022-annual-meeting-2/) and [regional meeting](https://cega.berkeley.edu/event/working-group-in-african-political-economy-wgape-2021-west-coast-regional-meeting/) of CEGA's [Working Group in African Political Economy](https://cega.berkeley.edu/initiative/working-group-in-african-political-economy/). No stable website for the meetings but can check for upcoming events' announcements [here](https://cega.berkeley.edu/events/).
3. CEGA has hosted several conferences on the study of conflict in the past but I couldn't find a recurring one. Again, better to check their upcoming events [page](https://cega.berkeley.edu/events/).

### Designated Emphasis in Political Economy

Effectively a "minor" in Political Economy, this program aims to expose Political Economy students to an interdisciplinary study of the subject. At the core, it requires completion of at least three courses with two of those completed outside of your home department and participation in approximately monthly workshops. 

You can enroll into the program in the semester (or later) you take one of the approved courses. For economics PhD students, Econ 210A, 215A, and 215B qualify. For Haas students, PHDBA 279PA/C/D qualify. Of course, you can take a course in another department to get started with the program too. Details [here](https://politicaleconomy.berkeley.edu/graduate-program/program-requirements/).

While the exposure to an interdisciplinary peer network and approaches to Political Economy are attractions enough, there are lucrative financial benefits to being a DE student as well: a $1000 stipend for summer 2023 and a small conference travel grant. They may in the future expand funding opportunities to small research grants too! Details [here](https://politicaleconomy.berkeley.edu/graduate-program/).

Only PhD students who have not yet advanced to candidacy can apply for the Designated Emphasis. PhD candidates can apply to the Political Economy Network Fellows program that comes without the requirement to take courses but with the requirement to, inter alia, attend workshops. Fellows are not eligible for the summer stipend but can apply for conference travel grants.
