UC Berkeley has a stellar Political Economy group across various departments. This diversity, though under-exploited, is a strength but people are often not aware of the wide variety of seminars and resources at these departments.

Here I attempt to put together some basic details on events and resources for someone interested in Political Economy from an economics angle:

### Seminars/Lunches

1. [Robert Powell Political Economy Seminar](https://haas.berkeley.edu/bcep/conferences-seminars/seminars/): Mondays 12.30-2pm in 223 Moses Hall.
2. [Oliver E. Williamson Seminar on Institutional Analysis](https://haas.berkeley.edu/ibi/events/seminars/oliver-williamson-seminar/): Thursdays 12.30-2pm in 325 Cheit Hall. A mix of talks by invited speakers and brown bag talks by Haas BPP PhD students.
3. [Berkeley Political Economy Research Lab](https://twitter.com/xftrebbi/status/1312443798027268096): Fridays 1-2pm in 132 Cheit Hall. A low-stakes forum for PhD students to discuss (mostly, early stage) projects with peers and faculty members. Does not require formal presentations.
