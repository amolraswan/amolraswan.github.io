### February 8, 2025

I lost my father on November 16, 2021 and my mother on December 9, 2024. I thought often about writing down my thoughts the past couple of months, but could never gain the strength or the composure to do so. Today is different.

The loss of both parents has caused me an immense, unsurmountable, and inexplicable loneliness. At any point in my life before December 9, 2024, I knew there was someone in this world who always had my back and loved me no matter what. I could call this person at any time, talk about any thing, and receive nothing but love and care. My relationship with my parents wasn't completely honest, in that there were things I did not tell them and would even lie about (but these were just topics on which I knew we were culturally distant).

My life doesn't have this love and warmth any more. I have lost my solid rock. I am now ultimately alone, no matter what: I alone when enjoying a beer with friends, playing football in the field right across my office, when I feel disappointed in my friendships, whenever.
