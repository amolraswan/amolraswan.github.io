I am a third-year PhD Student at UC Berkeley's Haas School of Business. My research interests lie in political economics and development economics, with a focus on the study of bureaucracy. 

Before joining Haas, I worked as an RA at the [Global Poverty Research Lab](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/research/global-poverty-research-lab.aspx).
