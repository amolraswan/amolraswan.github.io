I am a (fourth-year) PhD Candidate at UC Berkeley's Haas School of Business. I am interested in political economics and development economics, with a focus on the study of bureaucracy. 

Previously, I worked as an RA at the [Global Poverty Research Lab](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/research/global-poverty-research-lab.aspx). Before then, I completed my MA in Economics at Columbia University and BA in Economics at SRCC (University of Delhi).
