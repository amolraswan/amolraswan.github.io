I am a first-year PhD Student at UC Berkeley's Haas School of Business. My research interests lie in political economy and development economics, with a focus on the study of bureaucracy. 

Before joining Haas, I worked as an RA with Dean Karlan at the [Global Poverty Research Lab](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/research/global-poverty-research-lab.aspx). And before that, I completed my undergraduate and master's degrees in Economics at Shri Ram College of Commerce and Columbia University, respectively.

And before that, I went to high school... (this "before" business can really get out of hand phewww)
 
I enjoy football, hiking, and disc golf (still learning, though). I am also a fan of sitting down for movies, board games, and trying out new dishes.
