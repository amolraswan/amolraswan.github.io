# Short notes on books I read/re-read in/since 2025

### Chip War (by Chris Miller)
An amazing read on the history and current geopolitical state of the semiconductor industry. Well-researched and written in an accessible manner. Also loved the short personal histories of the major personalities. I learned a lot and retained a little bit too, I think! In a discussion on contracting issues in innovation (companies under-innovate because they don't accrue surpluses gained by other firms), I recounted the fact that Intel and other companies paid billions of dollars to ASML so that it could continue its R&D into EUV lithography as an example of companies overcoming the issues in innovation that arise because of lack of vertical integration - I was impressed with myself haha!

### Persepolis
This is a memoir in a comic book format. The author talks about her childhood in Iran, her brief high school period in Europe, going back to Iran, and finally returning to Europe as an adult. The context is Iran's cultural revolution and the drastic change in laws in the Iranian society. She comes from an affluent background but she doesn't try to hide away the fact that her experience is only a particular point-of-view. At the same time, some of the things she brings up do seem quite general and it was great to learn a little bit of Iran's history. On a personal level, I really connected with her loneliness being away from home and the guilt she sometimes felt in what she could enjoy (despite struggling economically and socially in Europe) and what her parents (and family) were going through back in Iran.

### In My Time of Dying (by Sebastian Junger)
A short book by the seasoned writer on his near-fatal-experience that led him to question "How do we begin to process the brutal fact that any of us might perish unexpectedly on what begins as an ordinary day?" The first half of the book describes what happened to him on an otherwise ordinary day, the medical procedures that followed, and a tiny bit of his recovery. The second half turns philosophical. He reflects back on his experience and I loved his honesty about how the experience can help some people to be appreciate life more fully, it can also be pretty terrifying and debilitating - the latter is what affected him. Moreover, he is an atheist (his father was an atheistic physicist while mother was religious), but the experience forced him to confront the question of God. Part of the second half turns to quantum physics and how some theories posit "consciousness" being a part of the physical world. An interesting read, for sure, but more importantly, I appreciated the author's honesty in talking about his fears after the near-fatal-experience and his exploration and distillation of different ideas of life, death, consciousness, etc.

### What Wrong Went With Capitalism (by Ruchir Sharma)
